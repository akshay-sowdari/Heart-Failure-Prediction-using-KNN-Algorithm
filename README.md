# heart-failure-prediction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the no.1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, 
which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, 
and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. 

Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and the dataset Iâ€™ve taken contains 
11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk
(due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) 
need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help. 

We have a binary classification problem.We will make a prediction on the target variable 
Heart Disease using KNN algorithm to give best prediction on Heart Disease.
